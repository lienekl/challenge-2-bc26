# Multi-page Responsive Website

This project was created as part of a Week 2 challenge to demonstrate the web development skills.

The website is fully responsive and built using the CSS Flexbox layout model. It consists of four interconnected pages ('Home'; 'Services'; 'About Us'; 'Contact Us'), allowing smooth navigation throughout the site. 

## Key features:

Built using the Flexbox layout model

Four linked pages with consistent navigation

Use of CSS classes, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements

A 'Contact Us' page featuring a contact form that allows visitors to submit their details

Media queries applied to the header menu to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes
